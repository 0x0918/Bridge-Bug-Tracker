Hacks Reproduced
===================

The below table shows known hacks since 2021:

| Date  | Protocol | Funds At Risk | Root Cause | References | Code to Reproduce |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 20220802 | [Nomad](https://docs.nomad.xyz/nomad-101/introduction)  | $152M | <details><summary>`acceptableRoot[address(0)] == true`</summary>*Within the process() function is an assert (line 185) that validates that the message for the transfer is associated with a valid root.  By default, a root for an unproven message would be 0x00. <br><br> In an upgrade to the protocol, Nomad decided to initialize the value of trusted roots to 0x00.  While this is common practice, it also matches the value for an untrusted root, so all messages are automatically viewed as proven.<br>[...](https://halborn.com/explained-the-nomad-hack-august-2022/)*</details> | [twitter](https://twitter.com/samczsun/status/1554252024723546112) | [.sol](https://github.com/0xDatapunk/DeFiHackLabs/blob/main/src/test/NomadBridge.exp.sol) |
| 20220624 | [Harmony's Horizon](https://docs.harmony.one/home/general/introduction/what-is-harmony) | $100M | <details><summary>Private key compromised</summary>*the bridge only used a 2 of 5 validation scheme.  This means that only two blockchain accounts needed to be compromised for an attacker to approve any malicious transaction that they wished. <br><br> The Harmony Horizon bridge was exploited via the theft of two private keys. These private keys were encrypted with both a passphrase and a key management service, and no system had access to multiple plaintext keys.  However, the attacker managed to access and decrypt multiple keys.<br>[...](https://halborn.com/explained-the-harmony-horizon-bridge-hack/)*</details> | [twitter](https://twitter.com/0xIvo/status/1540165571681128448) | [.sol](https://github.com/0xDatapunk/DeFiHackLabs/blob/main/src/test/Harmony_multisig.sol) |
| 20220329 | [Ronin](https://docs.roninchain.com/docs/components/ronin-bridge-v2) | $624M | <details><summary>Private key compromised</summary>*The Ronin Network uses a set of nine validator nodes to approve transactions on the bridge, and a deposit or withdrawal requires approval by a majority of five of these nodes. The attacker gained control of four validators controlled by Sky Mavis and a third-party Axie DAO validator that signed their malicious transactions.<br>[...](https://halborn.com/explained-the-ronin-hack-march-2022/)*</details> | [twitter](https://twitter.com/captaindefi2/status/1508852842685153282?lang=en) | [.sol](https://github.com/0xDatapunk/DeFiHackLabs/blob/main/src/test/Ronin_exp.sol) |
| 20220320 | [Li Finance](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/project-showcase/dex/li-finance/) | $570K | <details><summary>allow calls to any contracts</summary>*The hack took advantage of our pre-bridge swap feature. Our smart contract allows a caller to pass an array of multiple swaps using any address with arbitrary calldata.<br><br> This design gave us maximum flexibility in what DEXs we could call and what methods we could call. This also allowed anyone to call other contracts, not just DEXs. Our contract checks to make sure that the result of the swap or swaps is enough tokens to continue the bridging operation.<br><br>The attacker started by passing a legitimate swap of a small amount followed by multiple calls directly to various token contracts. Specifically, they called the `transferFrom` method which allowed the attacker to transfer funds from users’ wallets that had previously given infinite approval to our contract for that specific token.<br><br>This worked because these calls were performed within the context of the contract, which had permission to transfer user funds. The attacker transferred these tokens into a separate wallet that he controlled.<br><br>Once the transfers were completed, the small amount swapped at the beginning was bridged, and the transaction was completed.*</details> | [blog](https://blog.li.fi/20th-march-the-exploit-e9e1c5c03eb9) | [.sol](https://github.com/0xDatapunk/DeFiHackLabs/blob/main/src/test/LiFi_exp.sol) |
| 20220206 | [Meter](https://docs.meter.io/) | $4.3M | <details><summary>missing `require(amount_from_calldata==msg.value)` in deposit()</summary>*The problem with this assumption is that Meter has two functions where users could make deposits: depositEth and the underlying ETH20 deposit function. The depositEth function fulfills this assumption and validates the amount of value in the transaction’s calldata, which is the value that will later be passed to the deposit function.<br><br>The other deposit function does not fulfill this assumption or check that msg.value equals the amount specified within the calldata. The attacker called this deposit function directly and passed it an arbitrary amount in the calldata. This value was then sent to the handler’s deposit function, enabling the attacker to drain value from the protocol.<br><br>Hundred Finance was affected by the attack because the local price of BNB.bsc was depreciated due to the hack. Exploiters were able to buy BNB.bsc at a discounted rate and use them as collateral for loans with Hunter Finance, who used the global Chainlink price for the assets. As a result, the attackers could drain uncompromised assets from the protocol. Two of the four opportunistic loans were repaid, leaving Hunter Finance out $3.3 million. <br> [...](https://halborn.com/explained-the-meter-io-hack-february-2022/)*</details> | [twitter](https://twitter.com/ishwinder/status/1490227406824685569) <br /> [blog](https://blog.chainsafe.io/breaking-down-the-meter-io-hack-a46a389e7ae4) | [source](https://github.com/meterio/chainbridge-solidity-v1.0.0-eth/blob/4aa52d503202fa50b6379be6696c73f2cd694864/contracts/Bridge.sol#L441) |
| 20220118 | [Wormhole](https://docs.wormhole.com/wormhole/) | $360M | <details><summary>fake account to precompiled sysvar</summary>*The `solana_program::sysvar::instructions` mod is meant to be used with the Instructions sysvar, a sort of precompile on Solana. However, the version of `solana_program` that Wormhole used didn't verify the address being used. <br><br>This meant that you could create your own account which stored the same data that the Instructions sysvar would have stored, and substituted that account for the Instruction sysvar in the call to `verify_signatures`. This would essentially bypass signature validation entirely.*</details> | [twitter](https://twitter.com/samczsun/status/1489044939732406275) | solana |
| 20220128 | [Qubit Finance](https://docs.qbt.fi/protocol/bridge) | $80M | <details><summary>address(0).safeTransferFrom() does not revert</summary>*the contract did not use OpenZeppelin’s SafeERC20 library. If the contract had used this library, the exploit would not have been possible as the SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom function makes use of functionCall() (function from OpenZeppelin’s Address.sol contract) which verifies that the target address contains contract code. This is not the case with the 0 address. <br><br> The exploited contract used a modified safeTransferFrom() function which instead of making use of functionCall() to verify that the target address contained contract code, used the call() function directly. As the 0 address has no code at all, no code is run, and the call is completed successfully without reverting. As a result, the deposit function executed successfully but no real tokens were deposited. The Ethereum QBridge caught the Deposit event and interpreted it as a valid deposit of ETH.  As a result, qXETH tokens were minted for the attacker on BSC. <br><br> By repeating this process multiple times, the attacker was able to build up a large amount of qXETH without depositing any real tokens into the protocol.  The attacker then was able to convert these tokens into BNB, draining about $80 million in assets from the protocol.<br>[...](https://halborn.com/explained-the-qubit-hack-january-2022/)*</detail> | [rekt](https://rekt.news/qubit-rekt/) | [.sol](https://github.com/0xDatapunk/DeFiHackLabs/blob/main/src/test/Qubit_exp.sol) |
| 20220118 | [Multichain<br>/Anyswap]() | $1.4M | <details><summary>a) fail to validate token, b) fallback does not revert, c) infinite approval</summary>*address _underlying = AnyswapV1ERC20(token).underlying(); It’s intended to unwrap the underlying token (“DAI”) from the its anyToken wrapping (“anyDAI”). However, token now is now the attacker’s controlled contract. We can see in the debugger, that this contract now returns WETH as its “underlying asset”. Multichain failed here as this function should have checked if the token address is indeed a Multichain token<br><br>IERC20(_underlying).permit(from, address(this), amount, deadline, v, r, s); Originally, the expected result was that the underlying token’s (“WETH”) ERC20 contract permit() is called to approve the router’s (this) ability to withdraw an amount from the user’s (from) address, as the user supplied a signed transaction for that denoted by (v,r,s). However, WETH contract does not have a permit() function! WETH contract does have a “fallback function” that is called when a function is called but not found. WETH’s fallback function is deposit() that does nothing material in this case, but allows its calling function’s execution to continue as it does not fail.<br><br>TransferHelper.safeTransferFrom(_underlying, from, token, amount); Originally, we expected that if we got to this line it means the signature in the line above was verified and now we can use the approve granted by it to actually move the the amount from the user to the router. However, the signature was not verified, as seen above. In theory, it should not be a problem, as although the attacker’s input should not have passed the signature validation, it did not approve the router access to transfer the funds on the victim’s behalf. However, Multichain’s dapp requested from all of its users a practically infinite approval sum. This insecure methodology is quite common in dapps, to save user expenses on gas. We had warned in the past that such behavior (we named it baDAPProve) can be hazardous in case of a rogue or a vulnerable dapp, and now this potential threat had materialized. By abusing this excessive approval, the function transfers the WETH amount from the victim account to the attackers’ controlled contract.*</detail> | [medium](https://medium.com/zengo/without-permit-multichains-exploit-explained-8417e8c1639b) | [.sol](https://github.com/0xDatapunk/DeFiHackLabs/blob/main/src/test/Anyswap_poc.t.sol) |
| 20210811 | [PolyNetwork](https://github.com/polynetwork/docs) | $611M | <details><summary>use cross-chain messages to call special contracts</summary>*The core of this attack is that the verifyHeaderAndExecuteTx function of the EthCrossChainManager contract can execute specific cross-chain transactions through the _executeCrossChainTx function.<br><br>Since the owner of the EthCrossChainData contract is the EthCrossChainManager contract, the EthCrossChainManager contract can modify the keeper of the contract by calling the putCurEpochConPubKeyBytes function of the EthCrossChainData contract.<br><br>The verifyHeaderAndExecuteTx function of the EthCrossChainManager contract can perform user-specified cross-chain transactions by calling the _executeCrossChainTx function internally. So the attacker only needs to pass in the carefully constructed data through the verifyHeaderAndExecuteTx function for the _executeCrossChainTx function to execute the call to the EthCrossChainData contract PutCurEpochConPubKeyBytes function to change the keeper role to the address specified attackers.<br><br>After replacing the address of the keeper role, the attacker can construct a transaction at will and withdraw any amount of funds from the contract.*</detail> | [rekt](https://rekt.news/polynetwork-rekt/) <br /> [medium](https://slowmist.medium.com/the-root-cause-of-poly-network-being-hacked-ec2ee1b0c68f) | [.sol](https://github.com/0xDatapunk/DeFiHackLabs/blob/main/src/test/PolyNetwork/PolyNetwork_exp.sol) |
